# SQL Portfolio

🙋🏻‍♀️ Hi, welcome to my SQL portfolio! 

📚 During my learning process, I have gained experience using databases for data analysis by querying with SQL. 
    Each repository answers a set of SQL questions built into a portfolio where I can refer to and study.

💡 The database used in each case, together with the script to answer the queries, can be found in the repository.
    I used MySQL for my analysis in SQL.

🛠️ Additional Skills:

In addition to SQL, I have also developed complementary skills in other areas of data analysis.
I am proficient in utilizing data visualization libraries 📊 and statistical analysis software 📈 
to enhance insights derived from SQL queries.

🚀 Thank you for visiting my SQL portfolio! Feel free to explore the repositories and reach out to me'
with any inquiries or opportunities.
